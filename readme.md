HUJO is a hard-edged, globally influenced electronic music duo from Chicago, USA, whose music and performances are made unique through the presence of high-energy live drumming, keyboards and vocals. Drawing inspiration from a wide range of music such as Chicago House and Juke, the raw analog experimentation of Cabaret Voltaire, and pop music from the Caribbean, Indonesia and South Africa, HUJOâ€™s sound is not that of two men standing behind laptop computers, but of a five-piece band with a full percussion ensemble. Their first release, "HUJO: Live at Reuben's Palace," is a fully realized integration of their live-instrument approach to electronic dance music with on-the-spot video recording and processing. Entirely self-produced, this full-length video album is the culmination of the 15-year collaboration between Hunter Husar and Josh Johannpeter, two of the founding members of the now disbanded dance-misfit group Mahjongg, who released 5 albums and EPs and toured extensively throughout North America and Europe over the course of their ten year run (2001-2011). Picking up where Mahjongg left off, HUJO, through their creative process, strive to boil their artistic history down to its essence: the honest product of a pure, two-way collaboration. The resulting sights and sounds present a dichotomy: a constant push and pull, a stream of questions lacking concrete answers; unfinished business. The questions: "Why must we make music together, still, after all these years? What music needs to be made? How do we go about making it, if at all?" The answers: please let them know if you figure it out.
